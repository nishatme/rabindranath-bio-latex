Package fontspec Warning: Font 'Kalpurush' is using the
(fontspec)                default features for language 'Bangla'.
(fontspec)                That's usually fine, because many languages
(fontspec)                require no specific features, but if the output is
(fontspec)                not as expected, consider selecting another font.

(fontspec)              
(fontspec)              This font family consists of the following NFSS

(babel)             There is nothing intrinsically wrong with it, but
(babel)             'babel' will no set Script and Language, which could
(babel)             be relevant in some languages. If your document uses
(babel)             these families, consider redefining them with \babelfont.
